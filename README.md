### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The repository includes a Codebook detailing variables and procedures, the R code used for the assignment, and the FinalTidyDataSet text file.

The CodeBook.md provides instructions on utilizing the code, understanding variables, interpreting the data, and detailing any transformations or procedures applied for data cleansing.

Within the run_analysis.R script, you'll find comprehensive code encompassing the entire analysis process outlined in these five steps:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
The outcome of the final step is encapsulated in the file named FinalTidyDataSet.txt.


### Review criteria

    The submitted data set is tidy.

    The Github repo contains the required scripts.

    GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

    The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

    The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
